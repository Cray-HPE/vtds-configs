    # The 'name' field is a short name you can give to your
    # orgainization (possibly an abbreviated company name or whatever
    # you like) that will be used as a prefix when setting up storage
    # buckets for terraform data in google storage and for naming
    # projects. Keep it short to avoid using up too much of the
    # available GCP name length limit when naming storage buckets and
    # projects, and use only the characters in the set [a-z0-9-].
    name: example
    # The 'billing_account' field identifies the GCP account to which
    # resources for vTDS projects will be billed. Get this from whoever
    # manages your GCP organization.
    billing_account: "04DAB2-3517FE-287093"
    # The 'org_id' and 'parent' fields identify the GCP organization and
    # parent organization in which resources will be created and
    # referenced. Get this from whoever manages your GCP
    # organization. It is common for them to be the same, as the
    # organization is the top of the GCP resource hierarchy.

    # The 'seed_project' field names a seed project where persistent
    # storage exists for use by Terragrunt / Terraform outside of vTDS
    # projects. This should be a project you, or whoever manages your
    # vTDS environment, created. It has no compute instances in it, but
    # it contains Google Cloud Storage buckets needed for Terraform /
    # Terragrunt.

    # The 'base_name' field contains the base name (without prefix or
    # suffix) of the GCP project (i.e. vTDS system) to be deployed. It
    # needs to be different for each vTDS system you create, so it is
    # typically overridden in the cor configuration. It is specified
    # here only to make sure there is some setting for it.
    base_name: vtds-test
    # The 'folder_id' field contains the ID (not the name) of the GCP
    # folder in which the GCP project will be created. A specific folder
    # is probably required within your organization. Get this from
    # whoever manages your organization.
    folder_id: "525773635451"
    # The 'group_name' field names the group within your organization
    # that owns the GCP project that this configuration will
    # create. This will have been set up by whoever manages your
    # organization. This group should also have Storage Object Admin
    # access to the organization seed project, and should be assigned to
    # any user who will be deploying their own vTDS system.
