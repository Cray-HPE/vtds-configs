    # Compute blade. This is an alternative blade class that can host
    # Compute nodes. Using Compute Blades for systems with more than 4
    # compute nodes allows the Managment node to live on a different
    # set of blades from the Compute nodes and allows up to 16 Compute
    # nodes to be configured into the vTDS cluster. To use Compute
    # blades for Compute nodes, set the host blade blade class to
    # 'compute-blade' instead of 'host-blade' in the cluster
    # configuration of your configuration overlay and set the number of
    # compute blade instances to whatever is appropriate for your
