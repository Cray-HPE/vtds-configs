# A proof-of-concept sample core-configuration sample building a vTDS
# system using a GCP provider layer, an Platform layer designed to run
# on Ubuntu based Virtual Blades and hosting Virtual Nodes using `kvm`
# and setting up virtual networks using `VxLAN`, a cluster layer
# designed for `kvm` Virtual Nodes and a simple Ubuntu Cluster as the
# application.  Copy this file and modify or overlay it as desired to
# set up the core configuration for your vTDS system
# This file contains the base configuration (defaults) for the vTDS
# core driver. It is what will be returned from the get_base_config()
# and get_base_config_text() calls into the vtds-core configuration
# API.
