# Core-configuration for the vTDS system designed to demonstrate FSM /
# SCS connectivity over a virtual network connection between two
# otherwise unconnected networks. The resulting system looks like
# this:
#
#   - Two simulated data center networks:
#
#     + one with an SCS node and a couple of locally interconnected
#       non-SCS nodes
#     + one with an FSM node  and a couple of locally interconnected
#       non-FSM nodes
#
#   - a single virtual network (vXLAN) connection between the FSM
#     node and the SCS node that
#
#     + provides FSM to SCS connectivity
#     + does not provide any connectivity between non-SCS nodes
#       and non-FSM nodes outside of their respective networks
#
# This is built using
#
#   - a GCP provider layer configured to create
#
#     + Virtual Blades running Ubuntu 24.04
#     + a GCP native network Blade Interconnect providng
#       the Network underlay for all of the cluster networks
#
#   - a Platform layer designed to run on Ubuntu 24.04 based
#     Virtual Blades
#
#   - a Cluster layer
#     + composed of
#       o Virtual Nodes running Ubuntu hosted under `kvm` on the
#         virtual blades
#       o Virtual Networks implemented using `VxLAN`
#     + Configured to
#       o provide the nodes described in the system description
#       o interconnect the nodes as described in the system
#         description
#
#   - an application layer that deploys
#     + a simple FSM mock up onto the FSM nodes
#     + a simple SCS mock up onto SCS nodes
#
# The FSM and SCS mock-ups have REST APIs that permit them to
# to make simple representative requests of each other.
